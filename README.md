# Axie Utils Library
[![CI](https://github.com/FerranMarin/axie-utils-lib/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/FerranMarin/axie-utils-lib/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

I created [Axie Scholar Utilities](https://github.com/FerranMarin/axie-scholar-utilities/edit/main/README.md) a CLI tool that automates various activities related to manage Axie Infinity Scholarships.

This library is born from the need to re-use some of my code for other projects, something like a GUI or a discord bot. This will enable such things. It is also a good point for other developers to also use what I've already built and use it as a base.

This library has then NO monetization so it is free to use, of course, but I would appreciate any donnations to incentivize me to mantain it!
