# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will try to always have all versions up to date in terms of security.
This might change with time if some versions are simply too old to bother updating.
If that is the case, I will update this document.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please open an Issue with all the information you can about it.
I'd appreciate if you also include how to remedy such vulnerability (if possible).
